## STEM Fair

The Education Center represents the cornerstone of our mission as an organization. We want to foster collaboration at a GLOBAL scale, providing the infrastructure for people with similar creative interests to share, explore, and learn from each other....

As part of The Education Center we are participating in the Brookhaven College S.T.E.M Fair.

The items we show cased this year:

Building Play Dough Circuits. You can find more details here.
