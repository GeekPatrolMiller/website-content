## What is TheLab.ms?

First and foremost we are a community. TheLab.ms is an online and in person (meatspace) hub for the creative and the curious: engineers, artists, hackers, makers, crafters, and general tinkerers.

We are an all volunteer, 501(c)(3) non-profit organization and community resource.
