TheLab.ms is a collaborative space, and as such, we want to share and learn off each other.

The term "collaborative learning" has become increasingly familiar today because it is applied liberally to all sorts of educational settings.

This is where learning becomes a fun, burning desire rather than aiming for a high grade or degree.
Learning for the fun of learning, no commitments attached.

We host a variety of classes on a wide-range number of topics.
All of these classes are open to the general public free of charge.

In the past we have held classes on Python, Arduino, Automation, Virtual Reality, Network Security, and more.

Detailed information on each of our upcoming classes can be found on our [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/TheLab-ms/) page.
