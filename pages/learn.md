TheLab.ms is a collaborative space, and as such, we want to share and learn off each other.

We host a variety of classes on a wide-range number of topics.
In the past we have held classes on Python, Arduino, Automation, Virtual Reality, Network Securty, and more.

Detailed information on each of our upcoming meetings, classes, and events can be found on our meetup page.
