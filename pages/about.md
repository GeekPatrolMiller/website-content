## Our Mission

TheLab.ms is organized exclusively for charitable, educational, and scientific purposes within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (or the corresponding section of any future United States Internal Revenue law). Its mission is to foster a collaborative environment wherein people can explore and create intersections between science, art, culture and technology.

We have been inspired by and built upon the concepts and content from similar groups including: PumpingStation:One, Noisebridge, Dallas Maker Space, and HACDC.

Thanks

Our founding members have been very supportive, as well as the local security groups such as:

Dallas Hackers Association
DC214
Dallas 2600
Dallas NAISG
CryptopartyDFW

We also want to thank Daedalus Education for allowing us to use their space for some of our meetings. Daedalus Education's mission is to foster a positive culture of healthy exploration; one where students grow and continually discover how life and learning are inseparable. Their programs cater to high interest learners, providing a path through fundamental lessons, with an aim toward allowing students to guide themselves with additional projects.
