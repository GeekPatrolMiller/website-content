## Hack at TheLab.ms!

We're planning to build a virtual space with CTF, etc. Email jarod if you want to help set it up!


## Plano Hackerspace

The hackerspace is just one part of TheLab.ms!  It will be a place to collaborate, learn, and share ideas.

We want to focus on the following areas:

 * Pentesting lab
 * Monthly CTFs + our ongoing CTF365 team.
 * Programming group (github here if you want to join us)
 * Education and tools for topics such as reverse engineering, malware analysis, social engineering, and really any topic under the IT security umbrella. We'll also be working with The Lab's education outreach program to bring this knowledge to others, as well as to schools and promote STEM education.

Be sure to visit us in the hackerspace forums and share your ideas!
